# all_my_trading_algo_tests

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of all my algorithmic trading and quantitative strategy experiments, so I can easily revisit and reuse them when needed.

This repository includes scripts and implementations for:

- Retrieving cryptocurrency market data
- Trend-following strategies
- Mean-reversion strategies
- Hedging strategies
- Staking strategies
